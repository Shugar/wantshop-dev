            | Subtasks in Matterlist are proper tasks with priorities, due dates, contexts, notes and even with their own subtasks: Matterlist allows unlimited depth of subtask hierarchies.
          p.feature-text
            | You can assemble, rearrange and dismantle subtask hierarchies using the regular drag-and-drop. Tap-and-hold on a task, then drag it into its desired place in the existing hierarchy, or hover it over another task to attach as a subtask.
          p.feature-text
            | Subtask hierarchies can be collapsed or expanded at any time, allowing you to quickly hide the distracting details to get a birdâ€™s-eye overview of your todo list.
